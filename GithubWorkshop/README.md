# Part 2: GitHub :rocket:

## Step 0 - Project initialization
Create a repository and commit the files & folders contained in [project folder].
Some steps should be completed in groups of at least 2.
Go to your repository settings, and in the `Collaborators` add your teammate !

<i>Pro tips:</i>
> Don't forget to use the commit norm you learned in the previous part :wink:

> Don't forget to use branches ! This time, try to create it directly in GitHub :rocket:

> This workshop is based on [PoC Innovation's Open-Source project template](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/open-source-project-template).  
Several links to specific parts of the [getting started guide](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/open-source-project-template/blob/main/.github/getting-started.md) will be given to you, but don't spend too much time on it, we have a lot to cover ! You can read it entirely later.

## Step 1 - [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
There's a bug in the project (tests failing): create 2 issues (one to fix the bug, one to add a given feature, on two different branches)  
Method: result screen to reproduce or fully autonomous with correction after

<i>Pro tips:</i>
> Take a look at [labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) and [assignees](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users)

## Step 2 - [Pull Requests (PRs)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
Congratulations, you solved these issues !  
But don't close them yet, you will now learn to use Pull Requests and use the option to close issues automatically :sparkles:

Create 2 Pull Requests, and use 2 different methods to link the related issues.
When it's done, add your teammate as reviewer and play with the review tool in the `Files Changed` tab !

<i>Pro tip:</i>

> Take a look at [Closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests) ðŸ˜‰

## Step 3 - [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)
You can now manage features and tasks with issues, group commits and do code reviews with PRs, but how do you actually organize
your work in tables like well-known ticketing tools ? That's where GitHub Projects come into play !

> A [new GitHub Project experience](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) is currently in public beta. We chose not to cover it because it's subject to major changes, but it brings great features such as [custom fields](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects#adding-metadata-to-your-tasks) and [different views](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects#adding-metadata-to-your-tasks).

## Step 4 - [Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)
Organizing taks with states like `To do`, `In progress` and `Done` is great, but how to you handle deadlines and group several issues and PRs
linked to a sprint for example ? Milestones are exactly what you need !  
You can find them in the `Issues` tab.

## Step 5 - [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)
<u>Pro tips:</u>

## Step 6 - Branches protection settings (optional)
